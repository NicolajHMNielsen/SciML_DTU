Consider a forest where we monitor the rabbit and the wolf population because we
think they are the most vital part of the system and because they are easy to monitor.
However, in reality there are hidden bears around that greatly affects the population
of the other two species.

With only the data from the rabbit and wolf populations, will he neural ODE be able
to encapsulate the dynamics even without knowledge of the existance of the
extra variable? Say we use a augmented neural ODE with one added dimension,
would the dynamics of the added dimension resemble that of the real bear dynamics?

In the following we will:

1. Introduce bears to the Lotka-Volterra equation

2. See if the augmented neural ODE can encapsulate the dynamics with bears as
an unknown variable

3. Compare the real bear dynamics with that of the augmented ODE

## 1. Introducing bears

We will now Introduce bears and to be consistant with the notation let `x` be
*rabbits*, `y` be *wolfs* and `z` be *bears* and define the system as:


```math
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}x=αx-βxy-ζxz  \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t}=-γy+δxy-ηyz \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t}=-κz+λxz+μyz
```


we can directly define a function in julia:

```julia
function lotka_volt_bear(du,u,p,t)
  x, y,z = u
  α ,β, ζ, γ, δ, η, κ, λ, μ= p'
  du[1] = dx = α*x - β*x*y - ζ*x*z
  du[2] = dy =  - γ*y + δ*x*y  -η*y*z
  du[3] = dz = - κ*z + λ*x*z + μ*y*z
end
```

here `p` is a matrix which is defined s.t. one can easily adjust the parameters.
Here we plot with the same parameteres as that of the Lotka-Volterra system and
some arbitraraly chosen parameters for the interaction of bears for $t=[1,10]$:



```julia
u0 = Float32[ 2; 1; 1]
p_ = [1.5 1 0.3;
     2 1 0.3;
     1.1 0.3 0.35]
tspan = (0.0f0,10.0f0)
datasize = 100
t = range(tspan...,length=datasize)

prob = ODEProblem(lotka_volt_bear, u0,tspan, p_)
solution = solve(prob,Tsit5(), saveat = t)
plot(solution,label=["x" "y" "z"],xlabel="t",seriestype = :scatter,ylims=(0,3))
```

## 2. Augmented NODE

We will now pretend we have no knowledge of the existance of bears or we might not
have anticipated that they affected our dynamical system. We will, therefore, try
to encapuslate the dynamics of the rabbits and wolfs without including dynamics of the
bear. To do that, we will use an ANODE with one added dimension.

We explicitly take out only the rabbits and wolfs:

```julia
data = solution[1:2,:]
u0_🐺_🐰 = u0[1:2]
```

We define the architecture which is the same as in the [introduction](https://nicolajhmnielsen.github.io/SciML_DTU/ANODE/HTML/Augmented)
to ANODE:

```julia
input_dim = size(u0_🐺_🐰)[1]
hidden_dim = 1
u0_aug = Float32[u0_🐺_🐰;zeros(hidden_dim)]

NN = FastChain((x, p) -> x,
                  FastDense(input_dim+hidden_dim, 32, swish),
                  FastDense(32, 32, swish),
                  FastDense(32, input_dim+hidden_dim))

prob_neuralode = NeuralODE(NN, tspan, Tsit5(), saveat = t)

function predict_neuralode(p)
  Array(prob_neuralode(u0_aug, p))
end
```

We use square loss and note we only do it until the input dimension as the augmented
dimension should not be part of the loss function.

```julia
function loss_neuralode(p)
    pred = predict_neuralode(p)
    loss = sum(abs2, data .- pred[1:input_dim,:])
    return loss, pred
end
```

We now initialize an animation and set out max number of itarations to `1000`:


```{julia, eval=false}
iter = 0
max_iter = 1000
loss_vec = Array{Float32}(undef,max_iter+1)
anim_bears = Animation()
callback = function (p, l, pred)
  global list_plots, iter, anim_lotka

  # response in training progression
  if iter%50 == 0
    display("Loss of iteration $iter: $l")
  end

  # save loss (+1 as julia is 1-indexed)
  loss_vec[iter+1] = l

  # plot current prediction against data
  plt = plot(t, data', label = ["x" "y"],seriestype = :scatter,
                legend=:bottomright,color=[:blue :red],xlabel="t",ylims=(-4,5.5))
  plot!(plt, t, pred', label = ["x NODE" "y NODE" "Aug dim"],color=[:blue :red :green])
  frame(anim_bears)

  iter += 1
  return false
end
result_neuralode = DiffEqFlux.sciml_train(loss_neuralode, prob_neuralode.p,
                                          ADAM(0.05), cb = callback,
                                          maxiters = max_iter);
```

Something very interesing happend during the training which we can see in the loss
function:

```{julia,eval=false}
plt_loss = plot(loss_vec,label="log loss", title="Log loss function",
                xlabel="Iteration",yaxis=:log10,ylabel="log loss")
png(plt_loss,raw"ANODE\Figures\Bears\loss_bears_aug_1dim.png")
```

```julia
 #![](https://github.com/NicolajHMNielsen/SciML_DTU/blob/main/ANODE/Figures/Bears/loss_bears_aug_1dim.png?raw=true)
```

![](https://github.com/NicolajHMNielsen/SciML_DTU/blob/main/ANODE/Figures/loss_lotka-volterra_aug_1dim.png?raw=true)

For a long time nothing happends untill the very end where the training suddenly
explodes:

```{julia, eval=false}
gif(anim_bears,raw"ANODE\Figures\Bears\bear_aug_1dim.gif",fps=20)
```

```julia
 #![](https://github.com/NicolajHMNielsen/SciML_DTU/blob/main/ANODE/Figures/Bears/bear_aug_1dim.gif?raw=true)
```
![](https://github.com/NicolajHMNielsen/SciML_DTU/blob/main/ANODE/Figures/lotka-volterra_aug_1dim.gif?raw=true)

We now take out the computed solution and plot it at the end:

```julia
sol_nn=predict_neuralode(result_neuralode)
plot(sol_nn')
```


We now try again: 

```julia
iter = 0
loss_vec_2 = Array{Float32}(undef,max_iter+1)
anim_bears_2 = Animation()
callback = function (p, l, pred)
  global list_plots, iter, anim_lotka

  # response in training progression
  if iter%50 == 0
    display("Loss of iteration $iter: $l")
  end

  # save loss (+1 as julia is 1-indexed)
  loss_vec_2[iter+1] = l

  # plot current prediction against data
  plt = plot(t, data', label = ["x" "y"],seriestype = :scatter,
                legend=:bottomright,color=[:blue :red],xlabel="t",ylims=(-4,5.5))
  plot!(plt, t, pred', label = ["x NODE" "y NODE" "Aug dim"],color=[:blue :red :green])
  frame(anim_bears_2)

  iter += 1
  return false
end

result_neuralode_2 = DiffEqFlux.sciml_train(loss_neuralode, prob_neuralode.p,
                                          ADAM(0.05), cb = callback,
                                          maxiters = max_iter);

```

We see that have succesfully encapsulated the dynamics without knowing the existance
of the bears.

Lets watch the 3d trajectory

## Compare added dimension with dynamics of bears

Without the insights from above one could speculate the the hidden dimension
would take on the dynamics of the real bears. Therefore, we compare the dynamics:
